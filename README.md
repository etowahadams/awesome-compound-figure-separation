# Awesome Compound Figure Separation
A list of research papers on compound figure separation.

What is compound figure separation? Scientific figures often have many subplots or panels. Compound figure separation is the task of separating these subplots. This is important for enabling better indexing, retrieval, and analysis of scientific figures.
